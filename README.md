# Language-Widget
Widget for displaying the current language layout for the keyboard.
The script is being developed for the **Linux Mint** system.

This Widget was made for itself so that a pop-up window appears where the current keyboard layout language will be shown. 
I did this because I use an automatically hidden taskbar and it is not always visible which language I turn on.


## Current issues
The language switch key is incorrectly handled if the "Shift" key was pressed earlier in combination with "Alt + Shift".

## The current task.
Teach the script to determine the language layout directly from the system.

## Running the script.
* Save the script file on your computer.
* Run the command in the Terminal 
>python3 /home/path/for/your/folder/LangV3.py
* Add the command to the startup.
